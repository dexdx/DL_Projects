# Deep Learning Projects

These two projects were part of the Deep Learning course of the Electrical Engineering Department of EPFL.

## Project 1
Find the best architecture for comparing two handwritten digits (MNIST), i.e. given an input tensor of dimension 2x14x14 (two gray scale images of 14x14), predict whether the first digit is less or equal than the second one. We found that weight-sharing and auxilary losses are instrumental at achieving state-of-the-art performance in this task.

## Summary of the course
The objective of this course is to provide a complete introduction to deep machine learning. How to design a neural network, how to train it, and what are the modern techniques that specifically handle very large networks.

## Content of the course
The course aims at providing an overview of existing processings and methods, at teaching how to design and train a deep neural network for a given task, and at providing the theoretical basis to go beyond the topics directly seen in the course.

 

It will touch on the following topics:
 

- What is deep learning, introduction to tensors.
- Basic machine-learning, empirical risk minimization, simple embeddings.
- Linear separability, multi-layer perceptrons, back-propagation.
- Generalized networks, autograd, batch processing, convolutional networks.
- Initialization, optimization, and regularization. Drop-out, batchnorm, resnets.
- Deep models for Computer Vision.
- Analysis of deep models.
- Auto-encoders, embeddings, and generative models.
- Recurrent and attention models, Natural Language Processing.

Concepts will be illustrated with examples in the PyTorch framework (http://pytorch.org).
